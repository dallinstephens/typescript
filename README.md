# Overview

### What I am trying to acccomplish as a Software Developer
As a Software Developer, I am trying to learn how to build common applications that are needed in business and society. I am also trying to learn how to better communicate with Artificial Intelligence (AI) search engines to build amazing programming applications. To create effective applications with AI technologies, I believe it is important to learn how to communicate and problem-solve with AI search engines. I find it helpful in using AI technologies to problem-solve to build applications more quickly and effectively.

### Description of Software
This program is an application for uploading and downloading files from a server. The functionality also includes the ability to delete files from the server. This program was built with TypeScript, JavaScript, Visual Studio Code, HTML, CSS, Node.js, Express.js, and Multer. The file structure incorporates a backend folder for the server and a frontend folder for the index.html page, app.ts file, etc. Uploading and downloading files is a common application used in many industries.

# Future Work
- File validation could be incorporated for uploads that could include file types allowed to enhance security and maximum file sizes allowed to be uploaded to help save on storage space. 
- A progress bar could be incorporated to help users know how long it may take to upload a file.
- A login system could be created where users only get access to their own files.
